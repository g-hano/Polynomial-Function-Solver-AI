# Polynomial-Function-Solver-AI
This frustrating idea came to my mind while I was on the bus, and I spent quite a bit of time on it.
Main challange in that project was learning rate and initial parameters. At first I initialized them randomly but it was a bad idea,the loss was HUGE!,then a guy in Reddit helped me. [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/170m8jl/comment/k3mfcpn/?context=3)
